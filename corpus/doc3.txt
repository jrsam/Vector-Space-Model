The summer vacation had turned out once more. I was very happy as I forget about the daily puzzle and 
routine of school. I was unsure about my plan of summer vacation and was behaving like drifter.Ultimately
I thought to extract much from this summer vacation. I charted out my options to take up some types of 
exercise like running, walking, joining cricket academy, joining football academy etc. But I found that 
my inner soul is not satisfied. I thought to be honest to myself and planned to make the best of my 
vacation time during this vacation. Finally I came out with a better plan to taste journey and a tour
spot and to save myself from 44 degree Celsius temperature of summer. I decided to enjoy my native city
(Basti in UP India) in this vacation. The daily plan was quite different to that of tour spot. We 
discussed with our family member to take short tour of Pradarshani, fair and near by historical places 
of Basti and to remain at home during chilled hot summer day. I also decided to plunge myself into 
swimming spot if available there to enjoy swimming. At first day evening time we saw a Priyadarshini 
organised at the heart-centre of Basti. Subsequently we went to Chando Tal a historical place. 
Migratory birds are still used to come to this lake every year . At another day I went to swimming pool 
of a park. It costs around $ 3.5 but I thought it is very less than the expenditure of any tour's one 
day cost. I enjoyed the cool water. It was very great feeling to have the enjoyment like this in summer 
time. This summer vacation was not spent entirely in seeking fun but used as a part learning to enhance 
my weakness of Algebra. During day period of this summer vacation I finished all chapters of Mathematics. 
It is unbelievable that I had become so strong in algebra after that summer vacation. I recommend to all 
of my friend to target one weak subject in a vacation to strengthen the subject. I think weakness of any 
subject can be overcome.
