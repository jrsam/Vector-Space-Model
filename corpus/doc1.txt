As a child, summertime fun in the sun began with the ringing of the last bell of 
the day. It signified that it was time to throw away old home work assignments 
and to forget about anything to do with school-for three months at least. 
Summer time is a time of simple pleasures and exciting times of the year. Three 
months of late night sleepovers with best friends, hanging out at the 
galleria/water park, and not having to worry about homework had been lingering in 
the mind since classes began in the fall. When summer vacation finally rolls 
around, I can never make up my mind-on what to do first. 
Shall it be riding bikes to the park with friends or hanging out at the mall? One 
thing was for certain though, the family vacation. For some it was a dreadful 
thing but not for my close knit family and me. It meant getting out of town for 
a specified amount of time, either all at once in a two to three week period, or 
several weekend excursions consisting of camping and fishing trips throughout the 
summer vacation, the latter being a personal favorite. For me, nothing aided in 
forgetting about school better than sleeping under the stars, reeling in a trophy
fish, and breathing the cool crisp air. 
One particular family trip comes to mind. It was, I think, one of the best 
summers I had experienced. It was the summer right after sixth grade, my family 
and I went on a one week outing into the mountains. I can still remember the 
excitement and enthusiasm I shared with my family, especially with my sister. 
What made it so memorable was the fun we had out on the lake, five days of sitting
in my fathers lap as I reeled in what seemed like the biggest fish in the world. 
And who could forget the exciting water sports, the tubing and skiing made the 
whole trip worth-while. 
By the time August creeps up on you, you begin to wonder where the summer went.
